# Commit Conventions

When committing changes:
- Only commit changes made by the current agent (not changes from other agents)
- Use conventional commits format (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `style:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, etc.)
- Commit messages must be lowercase
- Commit messages must be 80 characters or less
