# Commit Conventions

When committing changes:
- Only commit changes made by the current agent (not changes from other agents)
- Use conventional commits format (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `style:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, etc.)
- Commit messages must be lowercase
- Commit messages must be 80 characters or less

# Translation Requirements

When adding user-facing text:
- ALL user-facing text must be added to the translations file (`src/translations/en.json`)
- The same key must be added to the Portuguese translation file (`src/translations/pt.json`) with the Portuguese translation
- Use the `t()` function from `./translations` to display translated text in components
- Never hardcode user-facing strings directly in components
