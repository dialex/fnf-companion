In all interactions be extremely concise.

# Commit Conventions

When committing changes:

- Only commit changes made by the current agent (not changes from other agents)
- Use conventional commits format (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `style:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, etc.)
- Commit messages must be lowercase
- Commit messages must be 80 characters or less
- If the user types just "c", it means "commit" - proceed with committing changes

# Translation Requirements

When adding user-facing text:

- ALL user-facing text must be added to the translations file (`src/translations/en.json`)
- The same key must be added to the Portuguese translation file (`src/translations/pt.json`) with the Portuguese translation
- Use the `t()` function from `./translations` to display translated text in components
- Never hardcode user-facing strings directly in components

# Testing Requirements

- We should follow the TDD methodology and write the test first and use it to guide the structure of our code. That improves the testability of the code.
- When adding a new feature, we should add at least one test, at the lowest layer (unit > integration > UI), that confirms that feature works
- When fixing a bug, first create a test that reproduces the issue, then change just enough code to make the test pass. That test becomes a regression test, in the regressions test folder.
- Test descriptions must focus on behavior and business rules, not implementation details.
  - BAD: "should call i18nManager.setLanguage when clicked"
  - BAD: "should call onNameChange when name is changed"
  - GOOD: "should change the language when a language option is clicked"
  - GOOD: "should save character name when name input is changed"
  - Test descriptions should read as non-technical requirements that a product manager could understand.
  - **CRITICAL**: NEVER use function names, method names, or "call" in test descriptions. Always describe what the user experiences or what the system does, not how it's implemented.
  - **MANDATORY TEST DESCRIPTION REVIEW**: Before writing ANY test description, check for these forbidden words: "call", "should call", function names (onXxx, handleXxx, setXxx, getXxx), method names. If found, rewrite to describe user-visible behavior instead.
  - **Before finalizing any test**: Review the test description and ask "Does this describe what the user sees/experiences, or does it describe code implementation?" If it describes implementation, rewrite it.
  - **VALIDATION**: After writing tests, run `npm run test:check-descriptions` to validate all test descriptions follow these rules.
- Tests must verify real behavior, not mocked behavior. After writing a test, verify it catches real failures by temporarily breaking the code and confirming the test fails.
- Prefer using real code over mocks. Only mock when necessary (e.g., external APIs, timers, or when testing in isolation is required).
- Avoid "dummy tests" that would pass even if the code is broken. Tests should assert actual behavior, not just that functions were called.
- Test describe blocks must use Title case (only the first letter is uppercased).
  - BAD: `describe('PLAY/PAUSE BUTTON', () => {`
  - BAD: `describe('play/pause button', () => {`
  - GOOD: `describe('Play/pause button', () => {`

# Save File Structure Changes

When modifying the save file structure (adding, removing, or renaming fields):

- Add a new migration function in `src/utils/migrations.js` (e.g., `migrateTo1_4_0`)
- Add the migration call in the `migrateState` function to run it sequentially
- Bump the version in `package.json` (patch/minor/major as appropriate)
- The `CURRENT_VERSION` in `migrations.js` automatically syncs with `package.json` version
- This ensures we can track which app version changed the save file structure
