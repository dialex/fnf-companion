# Header Component Tests - TODO

## Language Menu Tests

- [ ] Language menu shows available language options
- [ ] Clicking a language option updates all text on the page without reload
- [ ] Language preference persists after page reload

## Theme & Palette Tests

- [ ] Theme toggle switches between light/dark themes
- [ ] Theme preference persists after page reload
- [ ] Palette menu shows available palettes
- [ ] Palette changes take immediate effect without page reload

## Notes

These tests should verify behavior, not implementation details. Focus on:
- What the user sees (menu options, text updates)
- What the user experiences (no reload needed, persistence)
- Integration with i18nManager and theme/palette systems
